1. Performance

Lazy-load images & videos: add loading="lazy" to images and preload key assets.

Use modern image formats: WebP/AVIF with Shopify’s | image_url filter.

Reduce JS weight: only load scripts where needed (don’t drop all scripts globally).

Critical CSS: inline above-the-fold styles for speed.

2. Design Consistency

Build a design system in your theme:

Consistent spacing tokens (--gap-xs, --gap-md, --gap-lg).

Typography scale (--font-size-sm, --font-size-lg, etc.).

Global color scheme variables (--color-primary, --color-secondary).

3. Mobile-First UX

Sticky Add to Cart bar on mobile product pages.

Swipeable carousels (with proper dots/arrows).

Buttons large enough for thumb taps (min 44px height).

4. Product Page Conversions

Add trust badges (shipping, returns, secure checkout).

Tabs or accordions for product details → keeps the page clean.

Rich product media gallery (zoom, video, 3D model support).

Social proof: star ratings, reviews, and UGC (user-generated content).

5. Navigation & Discovery

Mega menu with featured collections/products.

Smart search with predictive results (“search as you type”).

Breadcrumbs for better SEO and navigation.

6. Accessibility (a11y)

Ensure every image has meaningful alt text.

Keyboard navigable menus/drawers.

High color contrast for text/background.

ARIA labels for custom components (sliders, modals).

7. SEO & Marketing

Structured data (JSON-LD for products, breadcrumbs, articles).

Auto-generated meta titles & descriptions with Liquid fallbacks.

Blog/article sections for content marketing.

Collection filters with crawlable links.

8. Customization & Flexibility

Add global section padding controls (top/bottom).

Add per-section color scheme toggles (light/dark).

Allow merchants (you) to set custom IDs/anchors for deep links.

Add rich blocks: text, image, video, buttons that can be reordered.

9. Checkout & Cart

Cart drawer with upsells/cross-sells (“You may also like”).

Free shipping progress bar in cart.

One-click discount code input at checkout.

Express checkout buttons (Shop Pay, Apple Pay, Google Pay).

10. Growth Tools

Newsletter signup with incentive (discount, freebie).

Social proof widgets (“X people bought this today”).

Back-in-stock email capture for sold-out products.

Wishlist functionality.

⚡️ Big picture:
Your theme should feel modular, fast, and conversion-focused — not just “pretty.” Every section should have:

Design control (spacing, alignment, colors).

Content flexibility (text/image/video blocks).

A11y baked in.

Performance-minded defaults.
